# Shogun
Shodan.io Command Line Interface

Shogun is a custom CLI for the Shodan.io search engine. The interface is designed to resemble a "shell" to the Shodan database. This way we can simply input commands to have the program perform various operations. As such Shogun aims to be a comprehensive assistant in the process of gathering open source intelligence.

Features include the ability to resolve domains, check if a host IP has any ports with certain services running and attempts to enumerate these services. It can also provide a summary of all the information Shodan has on platforms such as 'IIS' or Apache etc and includes a feature to log all information gathered in this manner and more.
